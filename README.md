## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- This was another opportunity to practice the use of various css properties, manipulating them to get the desired result.

- Although, the code is a bit messy (filled with weird class names, several code repititions), the overal result was close to the design.

- Making the design responsive was a bit of a challenge. I did my best though ðŸ˜‰.

- I also was unable to achieve the active state (when you hover on the equilibrium image). Despite several attempts, watching several videos,I still didn't get it ðŸ˜”.
  I hope to see a solution or tutorial on this in the near future.

### Continued development

- Media query
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS positioning
- Code Refactoring - DRY Principle

### Useful resources

- Google
- MDN Web Docs
- W3C
